See [wiki](https://github.com/NYPL/refile-request-service/wiki) for documentation of purpose and endpoints served. [Additional context can be found here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HtthNU6spmhV8TKCQEDWQ4kQvzdRd3UTfsVCFOLmvMA)

This package is intended to be used as a Lambda-based Hold Request Service using the [NYPL PHP Microservice Starter](https://github.com/NYPL/php-microservice-starter).

This package adheres to [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/), [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/), and [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) (using the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) autoloader).

## Service Responsibilities

This is a PHP Lambda for serving `/api/v0.1/refile-requests`. A "refile request" is a request to clear the status of an item, typically because it has been reshelved at ReCAP. Refiling changes an item that is checked out or "in transit" to "Available".

Refile is implemented as a SIP2 Checkin call to our ILS. This call generally has the effect of changing an item status to '-' ("Available") regardless of the status, with a few exceptions. The set of statuses we're most interested in are:

| Name                     | Status Code | Has due date? | Item level holds? |
|--------------------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Available w/out holds    | -           | false         | false             |
| Available with holds     | -           | false         | true              |
| Checked out w/out holds  | -           | true          | true              |
| Checked out with holds*  | -           | true          | false             |
| In transit w/out holds   | t           | false         | false             |
| In transit with holds*   | t           | false         | true              |
| On holdshelf             | !           | false         | true              |

\* Note that while it's technically possible to create an item-level hold on an item that is checked out or in transit, it's generally not possible with any public facing interface.

The effect of running SIP2 Checkin on the above statuses follows:

| Name                     | Effect of SIP2 Checkin                  |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Available w/out holds    | No change                               |
| Available with holds     | Status change to 'On holdshelf'. Avoid! |
| Checked out w/out holds  | Status change to 'Available'            |
| Checked out with holds   | Status change to 'On holdshelf'. Avoid! |
| In transit w/out holds   | Status change to 'Available'            |
| In transit with holds    | Status change to 'On holdshelf'. Avoid! |
| On holdshelf             | No change                               |

To avoid placing items on holdshelf, the presence of an active item-level hold causes this app to entirely skip the the SIP2 Checkin call and log the incident in the `af_message` column, where it will surface in SCSBuster. The following indicates which item statuses result in a [typically] successful SIP2 Checkin call (âœ…), and which scenarios we're intentionally marking as failed without attempting any SIP2 Checkin call (ðŸ›‘):

| Name                     | Result of refile endpoint          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Available w/out holds    | âœ… No change                       |
| Available with holds     | ðŸ›‘ Refile error; No change to item |
| Checked out w/out holds  | âœ… Status change to 'Available'    |
| Checked out with holds   | ðŸ›‘ Refile error; No change to item |
| In transit w/out holds   | âœ… Status change to 'Available'    |
| In transit with holds    | ðŸ›‘ Refile error; No change to item |
| On holdshelf             | ðŸ›‘ Refile error; No change to item |

These issues are discussed to a degree in [the Refile Overview document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HtthNU6spmhV8TKCQEDWQ4kQvzdRd3UTfsVCFOLmvMA/edit#). The fact that SIP2 is unable to clear 'ON HOLDSHELF' is noted under "20170818 testing SIP2 Checkin to clear on holdshelf". The behavior whereby SIP2 Checkin causes items with holds to be placed 'ON HOLDSHELF' is not noted.

## Refile Data Model

## ReCAP API RequestItem
(https://uat-recap.htcinc.com:9093/swagger-ui.html#/)

## Requirements

* Node.js >=6.0
* PHP >=7.0
  * [pdo_pdgsql](http://php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-pgsql.php)

Homebrew is highly recommended for PHP:
  * `brew install php71`
  * `brew install php71-pdo-pgsql`

## Installation

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install required dependencies.
   * Run `npm install` to install Node.js packages.
   * Run `composer install` to install PHP packages.
   * If you have not already installed `node-lambda` as a global package, run `npm install -g node-lambda`.
3. Setup [configuration](#configuration) files.
   * Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env`.
   * Copy `config/var_qa.env.sample` to `config/var_qa.env` and `config/var_production.env.sample` to `config/var_production.env`.

## Security

Authorization provided via OAuth2 authorization_code. Set scopes in the format of access_type:service.
For example, read:holds to access the GET request method endpoints.

## Configuration

Various files are used to configure and deploy the Lambda.

### .env

`.env` is used *locally* for two purposes:

1. By `node-lambda` for deploying to and configuring Lambda in *all* environments.
   * You should use this file to configure the common settings for the Lambda
   (e.g. timeout, role, etc.) and include AWS credentials to deploy the Lambda.
2. To set local environment variables so the Lambda can be run and tested in a local environment.
   These parameters are ultimately set by the [var environment files](#var_environment) when the Lambda is deployed.

Use `npm run build-node-lambda-env` command to generate the proper `./.env`

### package.json

Configures `npm run` deployment commands for each environment and sets the proper AWS Lambda VPC and
security group.

~~~~
"scripts": {
  "deploy-qa": "node-lambda deploy -e qa -f config/deploy_qa.env -S config/event_sources_qa.json -b subnet-<id> -g sg-<id> -p <profile>",
  "deploy-production": "node-lambda deploy -e production -f config/deploy_production.env -S config/event_sources_production.json -b subnet-<id> -g sg-<id> -p <profile>"
},
~~~~

### var_app

Configures environment variables common to *all* environments.

### var_*environment*

Configures environment variables specific to each environment.

### event_sources_*environment*

Configures Lambda event sources (triggers) specific to each environment.

## Usage

### Local testing with SAM

Start local test postgres db:
```
docker-compose -f db/docker-compose-db.yml up -d
```

Invoke on arbitrary event:
```
sam local invoke --profile nypl-digital-dev -t sam.local.yml -e events/event-checkout-peter-v.json --docker-network host
```

To connect to the local db:
```
docker exec -it refile-service-postgres-db psql -U postgres refile_requests
```

### Process a Lambda Event

Note that to run events locally, you'll first need to create a `config/local.env`. You can then use `node-lambda` to process the sample API Gateway event in `sample/sample_event.json`, as follows:

~~~~
npm run local-run
~~~~

### Run as a Web Server

To use the PHP internal web server, run:

~~~~
php -S localhost:8888 -t . index.php
~~~~

You can then make a request to the Lambda: `http://localhost:8888/api/v0.1/hold-requests`.

### Swagger Documentation Generator

Create a Swagger route to generate Swagger specification documentation:

~~~~
$service->get("/docs", SwaggerGenerator::class);
~~~~

=======

### Docker Integration

To build a docker image run the following command in terminal at the root directory:

~~~~
docker build -t {NAME_OF_IMAGE} .
Ex: docker build -t refile-service-image .
~~~~
> This will build a docker image installing all PHP dependencies and exporting the 8888 port for public use outside of the container

To run the newly created docker image locally, execute the following command:

~~~~
docker run -it -p {EXTERNAL_PORT}:8888 --rm --name {NAME_OF_CONTAINER} {NAME_OF_IMAGE_TO_RUN}
Ex: docker run -it -p 8888:8888 --rm --name refile-service-container refile-service-image
~~~~

#### Publishing docker image
... coming soon

## Tests

To run tests:

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap vendor/autoload.php
```
